A web application that generates **personalized Codeforces problem ladders** based on user handle, problem ratings, and tags.  
Built with **Flask (Python)** for the backend and **HTML + JavaScript** for the frontend.  
This is a simple API made only for [Codeforces Ladder](https://aesthetic-fenglisu-f5a976.netlify.app/) to fetch problems from Codeforces.
